# Introduction

This is a document package on modified gravity. We choose mathematica as the editor to show more details including the programming techniques.


## What is modified gravity.

* Popular science in Chinese: [http://astroleaks.lamost.org/?p=5374](http://astroleaks.lamost.org/?p=5374)

* What is LCDM model in Chinese: [http://multiverse.lamost.org/blog/2861](http://multiverse.lamost.org/blog/2861)
 

## What is the plan?

* Put different modified gravity theories in different files, so that we can merge different versions.
